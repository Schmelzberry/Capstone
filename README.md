#### 12-1pm

* 12:10: Last commit before lunch, done with React for today and want to research Blazor after lunch ~1pm.

#### 1-2pm

* 1:00: Read Microsoft Docs on Blazor, seems quite similar to MVC with slight name changes. Also checking Youtube for information.

* 1:30: Learned that Blazor and React are very comparable. Blazer is Microsoft's answer to React, it's meant to dynamically change UIs similar to how React can. Video:

* 3:50: Still following video from 3:00, I have ran into a lot of bugs where im trying to type too fast to keep up. Need to slow video down and think about why Im adding the code that I am.

#### 4-5pm

* 4:40: Still working on Blazor application but really like the idea of using C# and Blazor as opposed to React after spending the afternoon researching. I feel like next week I will be ready to start coding if I can definitively decide on the technology I want to use.
