## Research & Planning Log
### Friday, 12/01

``` 
8:10: decide how to proceed today - React or C#? Both?

8:30: Follow along with React tutorial making a React App that changes state and contains information about the React Library:

9:05: Done setting up Scrimba, the code editor for projects. 

10:00: Navbar style for project not updating, bug resolved around 9:40.

10:50: Main information section is functional, a static site made with simple components but haven't used vanilla React before

11:30: Finish up information site and look ahead to AirBnB Clone later in same React course, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8


12:10: Last commit before lunch, done with React for today and want to research Blazor after lunch ~1pm.

1:00: Read Microsoft Docs on Blazor, seems quite similar to MVC with slight name changes. Also checking Youtube for information.

1:30: Learned that Blazor and React are very comparable. Blazer is Microsoft's answer to React, it's meant to dynamically change UIs similar to how React can. Video:

2:20: Video on why Blazer is an important skill to have and discusses how it improves on React

3:00: Started following this tutorial on a full stack Blazor app. Ran into an issue with .NET not being installed on my PC and spent some time troubleshooting/reinstalling.

3:50: Still following video from 3:00, I have ran into a lot of bugs where im trying to type too fast to keep up. Need to slow video down and think about why Im adding the code that I am.


4:40: Still working on Blazor application but really like the idea of using C# and Blazor as opposed to React after spending the afternoon researching. I feel like next week I will be ready to start coding if I can definitively decide on the technology I want to use.
```

*CODED NORMALLY BETWEEN 9 and 12, commits show this
