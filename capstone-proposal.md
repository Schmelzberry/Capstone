### Project Title: Tattoo Appointment Scheduler

#### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

* I think of users as two sides of a coin - with unique customer and artist sides.

* In short, it connects people who want to get a tattoo with artists who are looking to work.

#### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Clients will be able to:

1. Register and log-in to account
2. Once authenticated, they can see a list of artists for a given area or shop.
3. Once a customer has found an artist they would like to work with, they can click on an artists "profile" page to see their past work and how they book appointments.
4. Assuming there are appointments, a user will be able to claim a time and leave information about the kind of tattoo they would like to get done.

* Artists will be able to:

1. Post their work to a profile page and if they prefer to work from their flash portfolio or do custom pieces.
2. Create appointments and communicate with customers to see what kind of tattoo they want done.

#### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* Front End - React
* Back End - c# possibly needed for API calls?
* Database/Backend - Firestore w noSQL

#### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* I would like to add mobile capability upon reaching mvp.

*Incorporating payments

* Using OAuth to authenticate users would be cool to add.

#### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* I know I would like to use the stripe API for payments, and will need to utilize tokening for OAuth. 

* React Native for adding mobile-friendly version of application.

#### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

* Nothing comes to mind after today's research. I'm leaning towards c# and blazer as opposed to React, but I still want to improve my React skills. I feel like I need to spend more time actually coding, where the bulk of today was spent researching.
